//This works for notes.

//fn stands for function, main function is the starting point.
//Pretty similar to what we use on c# actually, with our Main() function on basically any program.
//To run a rust program in the termina will run 'rustc {fileName}' to build the program, and then the build can be ran anywhere.
//To actually run the exe from the cmd we do ./{file}.exe
fn main(){
    println!("Hello World!");
}

//cargo creates a project, pretty similar like any framework like react or angular.
//To start a project with cargo would be "cargo new {project_name}"
//To create a build similar to rustc we use "cargo build", again this is pretty similar to any npm framework.
//It creates a target/debug folder, and how it looks, seems pretty similar to hwo you build c# deskto projects.
//'cargo run' will basically go into that folder an run the exe.

//'cargo check' works pretty similar to building the app in visual studio, but without building the app. It will just check if all files are going to be viable.

//'rustfmt' will let us format the files to match better practices on spacing and stuff for rust.
